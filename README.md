# My Web Application

This project consists of a simple web application that utilizes a backend written in Go and a frontend built with HTML and CSS. The application features a form for user input and displays the submitted data in a table.

- **Backend**: This folder contains the Go server that handles incoming requests and processes data submitted from the frontend.
- **Frontend**: This folder includes the HTML file and CSS stylesheet for the user interface.

## Features

- A simple form that collects user information (first name, last name, and operating system).
- Displays submitted data in a table below the form.
- Built with Docker for easy deployment and scalability.


### Customization

Feel free to customize any section of the README to better fit your project. You might want to add more specific information, like installation instructions for any required tools or libraries, or details about the features of the backend or frontend. If you have a license, include that in the `License` section. Let me know if you need further assistance!
